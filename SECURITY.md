# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not disclose it publicly**. Instead, report it privately to us at [your security email]. 

## What to Report
- Security vulnerabilities or potential exploits.
- Performance issues that could lead to abuse.
- Unexpected behavior that may pose a security risk.

## Response Process
We will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
2. Investigate and assess the issue.
3. Provide a timeline for a fix if necessary.
4. Credit reporters if they wish (unless anonymity is requested).

Thank you for helping us keep the project secure!
